			<P>Here you can establish your license to use FileBox as well as "back it up" to a floppy disk or other removable media for use if your system is accidentally disabled, or if you have to reinstall the program due to a virus or hard disk failure. Licenses are provided with complete instructions on how to implement them when you order them. The process is very simple, and involves using the Windows clipboard. You'll receive your license code numbers via E-mail, with the procedure explained to you at that time.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Delete this license</B><BR>
				if you're planning on selling this computer with FileBox installed, you should delete this license. Or if you're planning on not using FileBox any longer, you can remove the license. You may want to back it up first, for safety. (Please tell us why, if you're going to stop using it, and contact our support address if you're having a problem before stopping!)</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Backup this license<BR>
				</B>copies the license data to a safe location. You can choose where you want it backed up (a labeled floppy disk is a great place). Keep the backed-up license in a safe place in the event you need to re-apply it at a later date.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Order more licenses</B><BR>
				directs you to the section of this help file that explains how you can order more copies of FileBox, and how you can get in touch with us to find out more about the program if you need information regarding bulk licenses and so forth.</P>
