			<P>This tab lets you set certain options related to the buttons used by FileBox, how they'll be displayed (or if they will), some aspects of their operation, as well as their exact placements.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><A name="_Idx11"></A><A name="_Idx12"></A><A name="_Idx13"></A><A name="_Idx14"></A><B>Push-pin button to keep windows on top<BR>
				</B>check this to enable FileBox's powerful "stay on top" feature which lets you click on a small button showing a thumbtack graphic to lock the application window showing that button "on top." This allows you to use other applications while still viewing the contents of the window whose display you've set to display above every other window. Note that this doesn't mean you cannot access other windows, it means the locked window will always appear above any other window or dialog box.</P>
			<P style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"><SPAN style="font-family:Symbol"><IMG width="11" height="11" src="../images/image8.gif" alt="*"><SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN>If you enable this function on a window that's full-screen, you won't be able to see any applications running beneath this window. If you enable this on a window that is set in the "middle" of the screen, you may obscure message dialogs or other items that could appear from the system or from other programs, because they can't appear over the "locked" window. It's a great feature, but remember this limitation: in effect it makes the locked-on-top window the "boss" of the screen.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><A name="_Idx15"></A><B>Roll-up button to display only the title bar of a window, hide the rest<BR>
				</B>check this to enable FileBox's powerful "roll-up" feature which lets you uncover what is beneath of a window by rolling it up - essentially hiding all of the window, except for the title bar.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><A name="_Idx16"></A><B>Favorites button on file boxes / Explorer folders<BR>
				</B>check these (you can check either/or) to enable the Favorites button to appear on your Save or Open file dialog boxes and Explorer windows, too. You can set this individually, choosing to have the Favorite button only on Explorer windows and not on file dialogs, or any combination you prefer.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><A name="_Idx17"></A><B>Recent folders button on file boxes / Explorer folders<BR>
				</B>check these to enable the Recent folders button on your file dialog boxes and/or your Explorer windows. Just as with the Favorites button, you can choose to which type of window or dialog you attach the buttons.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><A name="_Idx18"></A><B>Move FbX buttons to left by … pixels<BR>
				</B>this function lets you make a very fine "pixel-by-pixel" adjustment to the placement of the FileBox buttons. With some video drivers, and with some settings within the Windows display properties (such as font or button sizes) you may need to adjust the placement of the buttons to avoid having them "collide" with the default buttons that control window placement within Windows, or with buttons placed there by other programs. Try moving the buttons two or three pixels at a time if you encounter problems, until they look right to you.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><B>Move FbX buttons to left by … more pixels, if a window is maximized<BR>
				</B>this allows you to make an additional adjustment to the placement of FileBox's buttons when a window is set to display full screen. Sometimes the buttons need this additional "kick over" to make them look right. Just as with the above setting, try a value of two or three pixels at a time until things look as you'd like them to appear.</P>
			<P>If you're using the Microsoft Office Shortcut Toolbar in its <I>Auto Fit into Title Bar area</I><B> </B>mode, it will cover the FileBox eXtender buttons on a maximized window. This would usually affect Explorer windows, as regular Windows file dialog boxes can't be maximized and therefore aren't subject to this error.</P>
			<P>If this happens, enter a larger value into this field, something between 200 to 400, to have the FileBox eXtender buttons moved much farther to the left on maximized windows. Then FileBox eXtender will "skip over" the MS Office Shortcut<I> </I>Toolbar and the FileBox buttons will still be visible.</P>
			<P>Experiment with the best value that works well for your system, it may take a few adjustments to get a visual placement that "looks right", to you.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><B>Do not use XP Style buttons</B><BR>
				enable this option if you use some third party utility to change the default Windows XP styles of button color and shapes, which FbX is not able to emulate correctly. In this case FbX buttons will be standard, old style 3D gray buttons.</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><B>Display FbX icon in the System Tray</B><BR>
				checks whether or not you'd like the program to show the little folder and heart icon in the Windows system tray area. If you un-check this, it's a bit less convenient to get at the program's configuration tabs to change settings. Note that the icon will be hidden only if the FileBox buttons on dialogs and/or Explorer are enabled. Otherwise, were you to disable the System Tray icon, you'd have no way of re-enabling the program, changing settings, or easily closing it!</P>
			<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
			<P><B>Display folders in "Explore" mode, with directory tree on left</B><BR>
				this option causes the program to set Explorer to load destination folders in "two pane" mode. This means if you elect to open a folder (say <I>c:\windows</I>) from your Favorites menu, the Explorer window for this choice will appear with two panes instead of one. The rightmost pane shows the contents of <I>c:\windows</I>, and the leftmost will show the folder tree on that disk with the current folder being <I>c:\windows</I>. If you like the two-pane Explorer view, then you'll want to enable this option. If you prefer seeing only the contents of a folder and not having the options to jump up and down around that folder, you'll want this option unchecked.</P>
