			<P>Some programs may not "like" having the extra buttons added to their dialog boxes. It's hard to predict which programs may adapt well to this and which may not. If you encounter a program that does not respond well to FileBox, it's not necessary to stop using our program---you can simply tell it to ignore the offending piece of software. That way you'll get the benefits of FileBox, its improvement to Windows Explorer, without having problems caused by programs that don't adjust well to its added functions.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Add program to exceptions<BR>
				</B>click this to pick an EXE or DLL file (which is a program or program library) to add to the list of exceptions. If you're not sure which EXE file a program might be using, look at the properties shortcut for that program by right-clicking its Start Menu shortcut and picking Properties. Examine the path to the program's EXE (called an executable). It will contain a full path, usually, and an EXE name. For example, <I>c:\windows\notepad.exe</I>. Once you've found the EXE, you can navigate using FileBox's Add program to exceptions function. Then set the exact exclusions you wish to establish using the functions listed below.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Delete Program from Exceptions<BR>
				</B>click this button to delete the selected program from "Exception List" and have it handled by FileBox eXtender normally, as all other programs.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Do not handle this program at all<BR>
				</B>this tells FileBox to totally ignore this program and not to "touch" it's user interface. This is the broadest exclusion, and in effect as far as this program is concerned, FileBox will not exist.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>No pushpin button<BR>
				</B>check this to disable the "stay on top" function. Some programs do not properly handle this setting and may not like other programs setting their focus state to "locked but not current." If you encounter a problem with a program becoming unresponsive after clicking the pushpin, or if after you've un-clicked the pushpin the program will still not go to the "back" of the window task stack, then you should disable the pushpin here.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>No roll-up button<BR>
				</B>check this to disable the "roll-up" button on selected program.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>No Favorites or Recent button<BR>
				</B>if checked, will prevent FileBox from adding the Favorites or Recent buttons to the program's interface.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Allow horizontal resize of file boxes<BR>
				</B>checking this forces the specified program to accept horizontal resizing of its file boxes. Some programs want these boxes "fixed" and may not properly accept requests to size them, or they may display the contents improperly if the size is not what they expect. This is likely to be a very rare problem with properly-programmed applications that use the common Windows dialog boxes.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Allow vertical resize of file boxes<BR>
				</B>essentially the same as the function above, only for the other axis of size. If the program does not properly display the contents of dialog boxes when FileBox resizes, you can disable that function by un-checking this.</P>
